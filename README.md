# Delivery App Redux-Toolkit
[Demo](https://delivery-app-eliftech-test-task.vercel.app/)

This app was created using the Edamam API to provide users with quick and easy access to food ordering.

## This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

I used:

- ReactJS: functional components and hooks
- Redux-Toolkit
- React-router-dom
- React-hook-form
- Edamam API
- Axios
- Material-UI
- JSON server
- Vercel for Demo

#### To start the app do (development):

Firstly, you must add the file **.env** with your Edamam API access key and id.

> Note: You can generate it in https://www.edamam.com/.

You can see the file **.env-sample** - example of what it should look.

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```
